OS 101 Unit 2: What Exactly is Open Science (OS)?

## Unit 2 Objectives

### Introduction

In Unit 1 we discussed the burden of proof and the perceived lack of social and stakeholder trust in the sciences.  

This unit will explore a related issue: the ability to build up evidence of the validity of a research finding by repeating the original study to make sure that the finding reflects a causal relationship and not just random chance.  

### Objectives

After finishing this unit, you should be able to explain

-   what the Replication Crisis is; and
-   how Open Science proposes to address it.

## A Replication Crisis

### Introduction

Open Science addresses many problems with how research is done. At its core, it aims to ensure that research can be confirmed through replication, and that both new discoveries and replications of previous research get rewarded in a similar way.

### Replication

Although scientific progress rests on the repetition and reproduction of results, efforts at this are hindered by two main factors:

-   First, there is a desire for the new and shiny; that is, novel studies are more interesting.
-   Second, many studies cannot be competently analyzed or replicated. This is because critical information about them -- design, data, methods, lab notes, analyses and code -- may not be made available.

### A Bit of History

Prior to the 20th century, most research data and findings could accompany their research findings. This is in part because the scale of data collection and computation was significantly smaller than it is now. It is also in part because science communication took the form of lengthy treatises exploring a question, rather than the short journal articles we see today.

### A Crisis

Nowadays, however, the traditional means of communicating research, the journal article, has not kept pace with the need to capture the ever-growing quantities of data and complex methods used in research. As such, research is often not accompanied by its underlying data or the detailed methods used.

In the last decade, increased awareness of these two issues, particularly in the social and life sciences, has grown to the point where many researchers describe it as a crisis: the **replication crisis**.

## Flashy Science or Good Science?

### Introduction

New and original findings are exciting. Conducting a study over and over and getting the same results, not so much so. The consequence for science? Flashy findings get published and a lot of attention. Re-testing, or replicating these studies, not so much.

The result? Novel research gets funded and published. Sometimes, it appears, the excitement factor overrides the quality (or lack of quality) of the science.

### Incentives

Replication studies are hard to fund, and many journals are not interested in publishing them. And universities and scientific institutes offer career rewards to those who publish novel findings in prestigious journals.

Academia and industry alike reward the publication of positive and significant results. Scientists may unwittingly “bend the rules” of science trying to get results worthy of publication. "Bending the rules" in this context is also known as engaging in Questionable Research Practices (QRPs).

### Questionable Research Practices

It's important to note though that when QRPs arise in research, it's not because researchers are purposefully trying to do bad science. QRPs happen because of a complex system of interactions within and around the research process and the need for researchers to get published. After all, publications are the bread and butter of a researcher. And unfortunately, this can mean that sometimes style trumps substance, as Daniel Engber notes in his _Slate_ article “[Cancer Research Is Broken (Links to an external site.)](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/future_tense/2016/04/biomedicine_facing_a_worse_replication_crisis_than_the_one_plaguing_psychology.html)”.

## Enter Open Science

### Introduction

Open Science is a movement that tries to combat the replication crisis, QRPs, and style trumping substance in two ways:

-   By providing different incentives for research. That is, changing what we measure as a success in research, shifting from a culture that focuses rewards on novel findings to a culture that also rewards the many other aspects of practising good science.
-   By making all parts of the scientific research process transparent and accessible, allowing for a critical review of how a study was conducted, and ultimately enabling that study to be reproduced.

### Open Science Ideals

What sort of changes, then, would we expect Open Science to bring? Imagine a world where:

-   Publications and data are freely available;
-   Conclusions and public policy are based on solid information and analysis that are clearly evident to all;
-   Studies can be tested and repeated;
-   Researchers without extensive funding or resources can still participate and collaborate in science;
-   Good science -- rather than flashy science, regardless of quality -- brings economic rewards to those who practise it;
-   The public trusts science and may be actively involved in research.

## Unit 2 Quiz

### Question 1 (1 pt)

What kinds of information are needed to replicate a study? Check all possible answers.

☐ Data sets used

☐ Methods used

☐ Programming code used

☐ Names of patients in the study (if a medical study)

☐ Analysis techniques used

☐ Documentation of how data were collected

### Question 2 (1 pt)

☐ Why is it hard to get replication studies funded and published? Select all that apply.

☐ Group of answer choices

☐ Journals are keener to publish findings that are new and flashy. Replication studies are boring!

☐ Current research and publication practices don’t require the publication of all of the information needed to replicate the original study

☐ Because the person who did the original study holds the copyright, other researchers have to get special permission from them to do replication studies.

☐ It’s pretty costly to keep repeating studies and doesn’t serve much purpose.
