OS 101 Unit 5: Challenges and Constraints

## Unit 5 Objectives

### Introduction
If Open Science brings so many benefits to researchers, science, and society, you may wonder why OS practices aren't more widespread. Technology has radically changed the nature of scientific research by making it possible to 
- create, store, process, and share huge quantities of data;
- make computer simulations of elaborate scenarios in addition to experimentation; and
- collaborate with coworkers and citizen scientists anywhere in the world.

We have both the technological and the imperative to open science in order to better address problems facing our society and our world, so what's keeping us from realizing our ideal Open Science research culture? This unit looks at the difficulties in implementing Open Science and strategies that will help overcome them.

### Objectives
On completion of Unit 5, you should be able to list and describe the following five categories of limits and challenges to Open Science and give an example of a strategy for dealing with each:

- **lack of incentives for adopting OS practices**
- **publishing industry practices**
- **time and money required up front to become Open**
- **privacy and intellectual property rights**
- **lack of knowledge**

## Incentives and Rewards
### The Current Reward System
One of the biggest obstacles in the path to Open Science comes from the difficulty of achieving a change in the way scientists are rewarded for their work, from publication in high-status journals to progression in their careers. What are the criteria used to compensate and promote science? As we saw in Unit 2, flashy science may trump good science: journals want to publish exciting research, and the career progress of scientist is gauged by the number of times their research is quoted by others, the prestige of the journals they publish in, and how much funding they can get. Most of the organizations that employ scientists, such as universities, large research institutes, and governments, are huge beasts with complicated organizational structures, traditions, rules, and procedures; change comes to them at a glacial pace. 

### Strategies for Change
Nevertheless, awareness of the advantages of Open Science practices is growing rapidly, many of these large organizations have started to introduce changes. For example, the three major Canadian research agencies -- the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) -- now require recipients of their research grants to provide open access to the resulting papers within a year of publication.  

Another area of change is a move toward basing the hiring, tenure, and promotion of scientists on factors overlooked by the current evaluation system, including 
- the quality (integrity) of the science
- the level of openness and transparency provided by authors at all stages of the research cycle
- the level of engagement with the stakeholders in designing and conducting studies
- the potential impact of the research on society. 

Progress in the area of revising assessment of scientists will likely prove slow, but scientists and leaders in the academic world are beginning to talk about reforming the process for assessing scientists. For example, a workshop in Washington, DC, in 2017 produced an a document identifying six key principles to guide reforms to incentives and rewards, as well as next steps to take to transform research and policy.

### Example: Undergraduate Open Science Research Awards
- idea of undergraduate research awards contingent on OS practices? could propose a fictitious scenario

## Publishing Industry Practices
Publishers of journals can make many improvements to their practices to ensure that they're publishing quality science and not merely flashy science and that their readers can access all important outputs of the research process transparently. Many journals -- over 200 in different subject areas -- have adopted a new pre-publication process called Registered Reports. Registered Reports introduces peer review of studies at the design stage so that potential problems with the study design can be improved and researchers are less likely to introduce Questionable Research Practices into their papers. 

These diagrams show how the Registered Reports format differs from the traditional publishing process format:
*(Are diagrams helpful here? If so, I'll make these myself in a different format. Couldn't find one for the traditional publication process.)*

Under Registered reports, when a study design passes the Stage 1 review by scientific peers, its publication in the journal is guaranteed -- whether or not it produces flashy findings!

### Example: Reforms at Psychological Science (Eric)

## Lack of Knowledge
Most researchers today haven't been trained in Open Science practices. They may agree philosophically with opening science, but may not know where to start in terms of modifying their practices. Those in later stages of their career may think that change is too difficult, even if their graduate students try to engage them in talking about Open Science. 

### Advocating for Open
To close this gap in education, Open Science advocates seek to make information about Open Science benefits, tools, and practices available to researchers at all levels. Initiatives include

- free tools like the Open Science Framework, a project management and networking site that allows researchers to display and interact with all products of their research
- OS education programs (including this one) at universities aimed at undergraduates, graduates, and early career researchers
- mentoring programs that team a researcher new to OS with one experienced with OS methods
- courses in specific aspects of Open Science, such as those offered by the FOSTER portal (a project of the European Union)
- https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/courses
- change will "filter up" as new scientists bring Open Science Practices into the workplace

### Example
- example: undergraduate OS program, workshops/seminars, COS ambassadors program, tutorials/guides, books, etc. 
- lack of knowledge about research study design, QRPs --> opportunity to inform 

## Initial Investment of Time and Money
- cost of maintaining data in an open repository - time needed to learn about OS practices - may need to learn new technologies - much more time required in planning phases of study (but reduces time required later) 

## Privacy and Intellectual Property Rights 
- fear of being scooped - free market incentive to create in conflict with opening science - public/private partnership issues - more important in some areas of study than in others - e.g. pharmaceutical industry 
- confidentiality of data (e.g. patient names, demographic information) - solution: anonymization of data - ensure security requirements for privacy of data are met (not all obstacles can be overcome)
