OS 101 Unit 5: Challenges and Constraints

## Unit 5 Objectives

### Introduction
If Open Science brings so many benefits to researchers, science, and society, you may wonder why OS practices aren't more widespread. Technology has radically changed the nature of scientific research by making it possible to 
- create, store, process, and share huge quantities of data;
- make computer simulations of elaborate scenarios in addition to experimentation; and
- collaborate with coworkers and citizen scientists anywhere in the world.

We have both the technological and the imperative to open science in order to better address problems facing our society and our world, so what's keeping us from realizing our ideal Open Science research culture? This unit looks at the difficulties in implementing Open Science and strategies that will help overcome them.

### Objectives
On completion of Unit 5, you should be able to list and describe the following five categories of limits and challenges to Open Science and give an example of a strategy for dealing with each:

- **lack of incentives for adopting OS practices**
- **time and money required up front to become Open**
- **intellectual property rights**
- **privacy and intellectual property rights**
- **lack of knowledge*

## Incentives and Rewards
### The Current Reward System
One of the biggest obstacles in the path to Open Science comes from the difficulty of achieving a change in the way scientists are rewarded for their work, from publication in high-status journals to progression in their careers. What are the criteria used to compensate and promote science? As we saw in Unit 2, flashy science may trump good science: journals want to publish exciting research, and the career progress of scientist is gauged by the number of times their research is quoted by others, the prestige of the journals they publish in, and how much funding they can get. Most of the organizations that employ scientists, such as universities, large research institutes, and governments, are huge beasts with complicated organizational structures, traditions, rules, and procedures; change comes to them at a glacial pace. 

### Strategies for Change
Nevertheless, awareness of the advantages of Open Science practices is growing rapidly, many of these large organizations have started to introduce changes. For example, the three major Canadian research agencies -- the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) -- now require recipients of their research grants to provide open access to the resulting papers within a year of publication. 

Another area of change is a move toward basing the promotion and tenure of scientists on factors the current evaluation system neglects, including 
- the quality (integrity) of the science
- the level of openness and transparency provided by authors at all stages of the research cycle
- the level of engagement with the stakeholders in designing and conducting studies
- the potential impact of the research on society. 

- the introduction of measures of science impact that go beyond citations, n
achievement of tenure and promotion goals for professors/researchers, 

### Example Undergraduate Open Science Research Awards
- idea of undergraduate research awards contingent on OS practices? could propose a fictitious scenario

## Publishing Industry Practices
- publication of replication studies
- guaranteed publication granted when study designs are preregistered of study  

### Example: Reforms at Psychological Science (Eric)

### Example: Preregistration

## Initial Investment of Time and Money
- cost of maintaining data in an open repository - time needed to learn about OS practices - may need to learn new technologies - much more time required in planning phases of study (but reduces time required later) 

## Privacy and Intellectual Property Rights 
- fear of being scooped - free market incentive to create in conflict with opening science - public/private partnership issues - more important in some areas of study than in others - e.g. pharmaceutical industry 
- confidentiality of data (e.g. patient names, demographic information) - solution: anonymization of data - ensure security requirements for privacy of data are met (not all obstacles can be overcome) 
- 
## Lack of Knowledge
Researchers at any level may feel reluctant to switch to Open Science practices. 
on the part of researchers and students - resistance to change, in some cases - solutions: education (starting at undergrad level), advocacy/publicity, mentoring programs, networking, specification of best practices - best practices will vary according to the area of study - badges
- example: undergraduate OS program, workshops/seminars, COS ambassadors program, tutorials/guides, books, etc. 
- lack of knowledge about research study design, QRPs --> opportunity to inform
