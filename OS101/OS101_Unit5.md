# **OS 101 Unit 5: Challenges and Constraints**

## **Unit 5 Objectives**

### **Introduction**
If Open Science is so great, why isn't it more wide spread?
  
We have the technological means, and indeed a duty, to open science in order to solve problems facing our society and our world. This unit looks at the difficulties in implementing Open Science and strategies to overcome them.

### **Objectives**

On completion of Unit 5, you should be able to articulate and identify a strategy for addressing each of the following hindrances to practising Open Science:

*   lack of **incentives;**
*   **publishing** industry practices;
*   lack of **awareness and training;** and
*   **intellectual property** rights.

## Incentives and Rewards

### **The Current Reward System**
As we saw in Unit 2, flashy science may trump good science. The actors involved here are four: researchers, publishers, employers, and funders. Traditional research outputs (academic papers) are coordinated by publishers, while researcher rewards — tenure, wages, and grants — are handled by their employers and/or funders.

As you'll recall, journals want to publish exciting research. You could say this is good business sense.

Funders, as well, want their projects to achieve clear, novel, and measurable results; they obviously want to be able to justify _why_ they invested in a given project. Employers want to know that their institution is having an impact — and researcher impact figures as an extremely important measure of institutional impact.

Researchers’ impact is gauged largely by the number of times their research is quoted by others, the prestige of the journals they publish in, and the level of funding they can get. Thus, the rewards a researcher receives depend largely on outputs of journals.

You can see we have a bit of tangled web here. Researchers may want to change their practices, but if such changes negatively affect whether and where they're published, they'll fall out of favour with their employers and funders. At the same time, funders and employers struggle to find other ways to _measure_ research impact to coordinate funding and to demonstrate value.

### **Strategies for Change**

Strategies for change centre on how _value_ and _impact_ are interpreted and understood in the context of research. And many large organizations representing researchers, publishers, employers, and funders have started to change the way in which they evaluate these factors.

A few key developments have sparked and motivated some of these shifts.

#### **Metrics for Assessment**

In 2012, at the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology in San Francisco, the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) was produced. DORA is a call on all parties invovled in the research process to critically re-evaluate how research is assessed for merit. It has since turned into a worldwide initiative with thousands of individual and organizational supporters. [You can read more about DORA here.](https://sfdora.org/)

#### **Funder Requirements**

Since 2015, the three major Canadian research agencies -- the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) -- have required that recipients of their research grants provide open access to the resulting papers within a year of publication. These same agencies are currently working on a similar policy for research data.[ You can read more about the Tri-Agencies Open Access Policy here.](https://scholcomm.ubc.ca/open-access/tri-agency-open-access-policy/)

#### **Journal Reforms**

In 2014, the journal _Psychological Science_ broke new ground by awarding badges to papers based on the level of openness demonstrated in them — an incentive for authors to adopt open practices. Badges were awarded for three types of OS practices: open data, open materials, and preregistration (filing their research design with the journal at the earliest stage of the study). These badges would then be added as images to the paper. Before badges were introduced, less than 3% of papers in _Psychological Science_ reported that their data was open. By mid 2015, this percentage had grown by a factor of 13 to 39% (Kidwell et al., 2016)!

## **Publishing Industry Practices**

Publishers of journals can do a lot to support more robust science and to encourage a culture of Open among researchers. As we saw, _Psychological Science_ found a simple, effective way for researchers to communicate how open they are.

As you might recall from Unit 2, one of the issues researchers face for getting published, is the need for their results to be positive. To combat this, and to encourage really good science, a handful of journals have started to support a new publishing model called Registered Reports.

In a traditional paper, peer review happens when a paper is submitted to the journal for publication: that is, _after_ the research has been done. This process encourages researchers to revisit their findings and try to find positive results where they couldn't before. This phenomenon is commonly known as p-hacking. We'll take a closer look at what p-hacking is in later modules.

In Registered Reports, researchers submit their planned research project to a journal and _the plan is reviewed_. If the plan is accepted, the journal guarantees that they will publish the article, whether the findings are positive or not! Peer review of the manuscript still occurs. But now, the _guarantee_ of publication — regardless of the study’s outcome — frees authors to focus on doing the best possible research.

## **Lack of Awareness and Training**

Most researchers today haven't been trained in Open Science practices. They would likely agree philosophically with opening science, but may not know where to start in terms of modifying their practices. And those in later stages of their career may think that change is too difficult, even if their graduate students try to engage them in talking about Open Science.

### **A Learning Curve**

Learning a new way of conducting science involves time and effort.

Depending on where you are in your career, this time and effort is more or less valuable and easier or harder to come by. For example, longtime researchers may struggle with time that learning will take away from their current responsibilities that have grown over the years, including managing students, administrative tasks, applying for grants, teaching etc.

The fact is, Open Science practices involve investing more time at the start of a research project, because they require you to think through the entire project, map out what you're going to do, and to try to foresee where errors could happen so you can prevent them or soften their blows. However, the investment pays off in increased scientific rigour and less time spent on the end of the project.

Embracing Open Science education may also mean having to grasp new technologies, and some people, even in the sciences, feel discomfort with learning new tech.

Finally, researchers may be concerned with the costs potentially associated with Open Science, from fees for keeping data in an open repository to time required to learn OS practices.  Low-cost or free options for data storage may be available through a universities or other organizations.

### **Advocating for Open**

To help researchers clear the learning curve, Open Science advocates seek to make information about Open Science benefits, tools, and practices available to researchers at all levels. Initiatives include the following:

*   free, easy-to-use tools that don't require coding, like the Open Science Framework (OSF), a project management and networking site that allows researchers to display and interact with all products of their research;
*   free storage for researchers, whether through third parties like[ OSF](https://osf.io/) or[ Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), or through their institution. At UBC, we have[ cIRcle](https://circle.ubc.ca/) for publications and[ Dataverse](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/ubc) for data;
*   OS education programs (including this one) at universities aimed at undergraduates, graduates, and early career researchers;
*   mentoring programs that team a researcher experienced with OS methods with colleagues new to OS; and
*   courses in specific aspects of Open Science, such as those offered by the[ FOSTER portal (a project of the European Union).](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/courses)

## **Intellectual Property Rights**

### **Introduction**

Our economy and legal system have long recognized the rights of creators of ideas, methods, products, etc. to own the products of their creation. These rights provide a strong incentive for research and innovation, both for individual creators and for society through the production of new knowledge, goods, and services.

However, as we know, Open Science also provides strong stimulation to the economy by improving the quality of science and industrial products and services, and making scientific knowledge broadly available to creators or potential creators.

So, intellectual property rights and Open Science exist together in a tense but interdependent relationship; policy makers and all of the actors in the culture of science must work to strike a balance between these two concepts.

#### **A Public-Private Partnership, the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC)**

The Structural Genomics Consortium accelerates research into human biology and drugs through a multi-country network that includes hundreds of university labs. The SGC makes its research outputs available free of charge, but its funding comes from private companies, including two giant pharmaceutical corporations, Bayer (German) and Pfizer (American). What’s more, it focuses on “neglected” diseases -- those linked with areas of the human genome that have not yet been well studied. Canadian nodes in the SGC include the Montreal Neurological Institute (“The Neuro”, a brain research centre) and the University of Toronto.
