OS 101 Unit 4: Open Science Benefits

## Unit 4 Objectives

### Introduction
In the preceding modules, we've talked a lot about what Open Science is, and what some of the core values of Open Science are. Hopefully we're winning some of you over with an ethos of practice. But some of you might still be wondering what's in it for you, your discipline, your country, or the world in a more concrete way. And we have yet to really pin down, from a benefits perspective, why we should be practicing Open Science.

### Objectives
On completion of Unit 4, you should be able to articulate how Open Science offers the following benefits:
- **Economic efficiencies** arising from higher-quality research;
- **Facilitation of large-scale data projects** through collaboration;
- **Improved responsiveness of policy** and research to public needs as a consequence of better and more inclusive research; and
- **Career benefits** for individual researchers.

## Better Science and Economic Efficiencies

### Creating Efficiencies

Open Science acts like a super-fertilizer to make science grow faster and stronger. Here's a quick review on how it does this.

 - **Solidifies the foundation of scientific knowledge** -- reproducible, robust research can be understood and replicated more easily;
 - **Accelerates the research process** -- data, methods, analytical techniques, and code can be re-used;
 - **Limits unnecessary research** -- publication of methods that have led to dead ends in research helps others in the research community to avoid making the same mistakes.

### From patents to Open Science

*I don't think this is worded very well, but I think provides a unique historical context. Maybe not. Just a suggestion.*

But let's take this back a bit and ask, why is science closed in the first place?

On a practical level, research in the lab leads to industrial applications, whether it's a new vaccine, a drone that uses microwave remote sensing technology to map root zone soil moisture, or a solar-powered train. In order to protect the resources invested in these operations, these applications are frequently patented.

So, in many ways, patents, first issued in the 15th century, initiated closed science. With patents, inventions are protected, giving exclusive rights of production to the inventor. And with patents, only the inventor can improve the product. This limits the ability of society at large to explore and expand on the techniques and technologies applied.

However, when we open up our practices, we allow for accelerated innovation, which means less expensive industrial products that take less time to get to market.

### Example: Open APS

John's talking to his cousin Bubba in the United States on WhatsApp. Bubba, like many individuals in North America, has diabetes. Diabetes can very expensive to manage.

John: So, Bubba, how's it goin' with the diabetes?  

Bubba: Pffffff, my control **what does control mean?** hasn't been so hot lately.   Can't seem to get it better no matter what I do.  

John: Don't they have an artificial pancreas now **can you add just a bit more context?**?

Bubba: Yeah, if you have 15 grand to blow on one.

John: Whoa, I didn't realize they were that expensive!

Two days later ...  

John: Hey Bubba, I just read something interesting -- someone down there is saying they've invented an artificial pancreas type system that costs only $200! Lots of people are using it. It's called OpenAPS.  

Bubba: You're pulling my leg. Must've forgot a couple of zeroes on that price. How could they afford to make it available for $200?  

John: They've moved the technology and code into the open, to allow more people to collaboratively work on the project. They're also bypassing traditional commercialization. Sure, it's kinda DIY at the moment, but it sounds like there's some real potential there -- they have a web page and all, [OpenAPS.org](https://openaps.org/).  

Bubba: Holy guacamole! I'll look into it. Thanks John.

## Large-Scale Projects

*I think emphasizing the data component here makes it more distinct from the previous section which is about pooling resources and shared knowledge.*

Through the pooling of resources and, in particular, data, a project that would remain a distant dream if dependent on a single actor can become a reality.

Such collaborations can involve different research organizations, researchers from different disciplines, citizen science participation, or inter-country cooperation.

One interesting example is Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, which now provides for the vaccination of half the world's children, pooling the data and resources of many countries and facilitating cooperation between governmental and non-governmental organizations in poorer parts of the world.

### Example: Yusuf Becomes a Vaccine Advocate

*suggesting moving this content around a bit*

Yusuf Ibrahim is a devout Muslim in Nigeria who was originally told that vaccines were part of a Western conspiracy to control the Muslim population by delivering medicine that made men impotent.

The elders asked, "Why would they give us this medication free?" Given their historical experiences with Western culture, this attitude is not surprising. However, when his beloved daughter caught pneumonia and died, he began to talk to doctors about his beliefs and to learn more about vaccines.

Now he's a strong advocate for vaccines among the people of his town.

[You can read more about Yusuf's story and the Gavi project at the Gavi website](https://www.gavi.org/delivering/nigeria/#InWords).

## Improved Responsiveness of Policy and Research to Public Needs

Involvement of citizens in research can help steer science in ways that help society and make science communication and science-based public policy more responsive to public needs. This means fewer wasted resources on poorly planned or implemented projects. Naturally, this also increases public trust in science.

The "Patient Expert" model of health care, in which patients participating in studies or treatments assume a good amount of responsibility for their own care and contribute feedback that can influence the course of future studies is an excellent example of this.

### Example: The CHILD-BRIGHT Network

CHILD-BRIGHT, headquartered in Montreal, networks health practitioners, patients, families, and research scientists across Canada to advance patient-oriented care of children with brain-based developmental disabilities.  This network was born out of consultation with patients and their families. The  [CHILD_BRIGHT website](https://www.child-bright.ca/citizen-engagagement) clearly outlines the importance of citizen engagement to the network's projects:

> At CHILD-BRIGHT, 'patients' have been at the centre of our work since before our network was even established. We understand that patients and families are experts on their health experiences and needs and we look to them to provide us with insightful input that will influence our priorities, research study design, the outcome measures we use, as well as the interpretation and use of our findings.
>
> As a network working under Canada's Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research, we aim to engage all people touched by brain-based developmental disabilities, especially patients and families, as meaningfully as possible in all aspects of our work.

CHILD-BRIGHT holds summer camps for children at research centres in Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto under the SPORT (Stimulation for Perinatal Stroke Optimizing Recovery Trajectory) program. Children in the camp receive trial treatments aimed at improving their motor function, as well as undergoing testing and imaging for research. Their participation helps to build data sets for studies, and guides the direction of future research. Of course, some fun is involved as well! Many of the children have reported improved function through the camps' treatments.

## Benefits for Researchers

Open science helps researchers -- especially those in the beginning stages of their careers -- in many ways:

  - **Increased visibility** for them and their research *detail?*
  - **More citations** (introduce dialogue *You're going to put in dialogue?*); for example, authors who publish openly may receive early coverage in the media
  - **Enhanced networks** chances to make connections, exchange, and collaborate. Greater opportunity for advancement.
  - **Greater employability** Reproducibility is also valued in contexts outside of the academic world, such as in industry and government: early-career applicants stand out if they have experience in reproducible practices
  - **Unique funding and publishing opportunities** compliance with the requirements that many funders and journals now have for open practices in studies

### Example: Exposure of Honours Work

*Didn't convert to dialogue, but did shift the narrative a bit.*

Sammie is doing their honours thesis in biology at UBCO. They're using a popular online tool for sharing research inputs and outputs, [OSF](https://osf.io), to help manage their project.

Sammie recently presented about their work at a local conference. Sammie's poster focused on high level outcomes, but provided a link to the full working project on OSF for those who were more interested in the nitty gritty of Sammie's work.

In the following months, Sammie started to notice that more and more people were visiting their OSF page. Some people were even downloading portions of Sammie's work.

Applying for graduate opportunities, Sammie was able to point to both their project work and the visitor stats it was receiving.

Three months after the conference, Sammie got the following email:

> Dear Sammie,
>
> I was very pleased to come across your poster session at a conference several months back. A colleague at your institution reached out to me more recently about your work and I have since had a look at what you're doing on your OSF page. If you're looking for a graduate research opportunity, I'd be happy to talk, as the work that you are doing would align very nicely with my research lab at *The of Joy Science Institute* in Florida.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> Dr. Bob Ross

As you might imagine, Sammie was pretty excited.

## For Later Modules?
   Improvement of statistical techniques (is this only in Psychology?): shift from reliance on null-hypothesis significance testing to estimation and other preferred techniques; reliance on estimation and other preferred methods. Dichotomy of NHST can impede scientific progress - focus on practical significance of effects and steady accumulation of knowledge

### Technological Advancement
   **This helps OS. Is it a benefit of OS?** - Hmmm, Mathew, you are probably right. I do think that open science has probably driven at least some technological developments -- e.g. platforms like OSF, open source applications like Dataverse, etc. But perhaps that's not a societal benefit in the way we're conceiving it, or not one that students could relate to.
