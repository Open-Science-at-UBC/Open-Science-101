# **OS 101 Unit 3: Core Values**

## **Unit 3 Objectives**

### **Introduction**

In the last unit, we talked about the relationship between science and society, and tried to imagine an ideal research landscape transformed by Open Science.

In this unit we'll dive a little deeper and get to the core beliefs that underlie OS principles and practices.

The fundamental values we'll look at include

*   scientific integrity;
*   equity; and
*   diversity and inclusion.

### **Objectives**

On completion of Unit 3, you should be able to identify how the core values that underpin Open Science intersect with the following practices and goals:

*   replicability;
*   collaboration; and
*   science communication.

## **Scientific Integrity**

Though we haven’t mentioned the phrase “scientific integrity”, we have looked at the critical role it plays in replicability and Open Science. Integrity involves sticking to best practices for research that promote reproducibility through transparency and open access. At the root, this principle springs from a sense of responsibility for public welfare and from the honest pursuit of scientific truth.

In a literal sense, transparency is the property of an object that makes it so clear that you can see through it. But what about when we talk about transparency in government policy, or scientific research? In this context, transparency implies a high degree of disclosure — revealing clearly the exact reasoning and process used in coming to a decision or taking an action. As well, transparency means taking care to disclose important information in a respectful and responsible fashion.

Scientific integrity implies several practices:

*   basing research conclusions and public policy on solid information and analysis that are clearly evident to everyone;
*   evaluating scientific work using fair, rigorous criteria and procedures known to all involved;
*   publishing good science, period (not just flashy science);
*   fully disclosing studies and methods that _don’t_ yield significant results;
*   adhering to best practices for creating hypotheses, collecting data, and analyzing results; and
*   providing equitable access (see the following two sections on equity) to all outputs of the research cycle.

As we saw in the last unit, these form key elements of our ideal research ecosystem, where the public trusts science and studies can be tested and repeated.

### **Transparency and Grading**

One case where students want and need transparency is in grading. Most of you probably appreciate knowing how marks were accorded to questions on a midterm exam and what criteria the marker used to score each question. This provides you with both a _reason_ for the assigned grade and a means of _comparing_ your grade with those of your classmates. Ultimately, this specific information can help you to fill in gaps in your knowledge and perform better on future assessments (such as the final exam). In the same way, transparency in research allows scientists to improve future studies and add to accumulated knowledge.

## **Equity through Access**

We do research to learn; we share our findings to build a culture of learning and to enhance the future of our disciplines. We also share to build community with researchers and other stakeholders.

But because there can be a range of stakeholders with different needs and backgrounds, it is important to communicate science in ways that accommodate these specific needs and backgrounds. Processes and findings need to be _contextualized_ (put into a context meaningful to the particular stakeholder) and _made accessible_, both in message and medium. The more avenues through which we share and engage and the fewer barriers to access we put up, the more equitably our discoveries can be shared.


### **Equity vs Equality**

Equity and equality are similar, but there is a key distinction: under equality everyone is treated in an identical manner, whereas under equity everyone is treated fairly according to their abilities and needs. The image below nicely illustrates the concept of equity.

## **Equity: Considering the Audience**

Equity in science communication can be explored in many ways; none addresses all issues of equitable access, but each helps to enhance scientific literacy in our society. Open access publications help to make research available to those who cannot afford costly journal subscriptions. Citizen science engages members of the public in the research process, contributing their voices to projects. Novel means and mediums of sharing a message, like podcasts or Twitter, channel findings to communities with unique access needs or preferences. In future modules, we'll explore these in more detail, but for now, let's take a quick look at how we can talk about science to meet the needs of different audiences.

Your Biology professor will change the language and techniques used to communicate scientific information to her colleagues or when she helps inform a government policy analyst writing a report. She will use a different approach again to engage you and your classmates in learning. In each case, she adjusts her communication to match her audience's needs, educational background, and experience. Her message isn't fundamentally changed or simplified, but it does need to be delivered in a way that is understanding and respectful of her audience.

### **Effects of DDT on Birds: Three Approaches**

Consider the following three ways of explaining how DDT affects birds, and consider the intended audience of each.

#### **Highly Technical**
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a persistent organochlorine compound found worldwide that causes significant anatomical, physiological and behavioural abnormalities in humans and wildlife. However, little is known about whether environmental exposure to DDT affects the brain. Here, we show that environmental exposure to DDT alters the brains of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) in several ways. Increasing levels of DDT resulted in: (i) smaller brain and relative forebrain volumes; (ii) a reduction in the size of two song nuclei, nucleus robustus arcopallialis (RA) and HVC; and (iii) a drastic reduction in neuronal size and overall volume of nucleus intercollicularis (ICo), a structure that is critical for normal sexual behaviour. These changes likely result from stress, direct [neurotoxicity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neurotoxicity) and [androgen receptor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/androgen-receptor) antagonism by the primary metabolite of DDT, p,p′-DDE and this is corroborated by analyses of brain region volumes and p,p′-DDE levels. Our results therefore demonstrate that environmental exposure to DDT is correlated with significant changes in the brain and specifically those structures related to mating and song. Given the magnitude of these changes in the brain and the fact that environmental DDT exposure was restricted to early development, we conclude that both humans and wildlife that live in DDT contaminated environments may be at risk of neurological damage (Iwaniuk et al., 2006).

#### **Technical, But Less Detailed**

Concerns about DDT's effects on nontarget organisms, including birds, were first raised shortly after the end of World War II.2 By the 1960s there was good evidence that living things concentrated DDT and that it was extremely persistent. For example, scientists measured concentrations in gulls, mergansers, and cormorants that were as much as a thousand times higher than the already high concentrations in the mud of the Long Island, New York marsh where the birds fed. The marsh had been sprayed for twenty years as part of a mosquito control program.

These DDT residues caused both acute and chronic health problems. DDT caused direct mortality of some birds by poisoning their nervous system even in birds like robins that feed relatively low on the food chain. DDT and its metabolites cause eggs to have thin shells and reduce levers of a hormone necessary for female birds to lay eggs. Population declines and local disappearance of peregrine falcons, bald and golden eagles, ospreys, kestrels, and other predatory birds were recorded (Cox, 1991).


#### **Non-Technical**
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks. It can accumulate in the birds of prey, giving them a large amount of DDT. High concentrations of DDT in birds cause weakness in the shells of their eggs, which leads to a reduction in their population. DDT is now banned because of this (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2019).

## **Diversity in Research Culture**

Diverse criticism of scientific ideas makes research more robust, and challenges bias and assumptions that might otherwise pass unchecked. Divergent perspectives, skill sets, and ideas introduce the "outside-of-the-box" thinking that drives research forward. Diversity implies another value, inclusion. This means making sure all voices are heard and respected in the research process.

Diversity and inclusion show up in many types of research activities that involve participation and collaboration. Participation and collaboration can take many forms. Citizen science engages the public in data collection and processing. Participatory research turns the relationship between researcher and subject into a partnership, where both contribute to the research question, process, and results. International collaborations can address problems that cross borders, like disease epidemics or pollution. Interdisciplinary research, such as biologists working with environmental scientists, can help solve complex problems like climate change by combining multiple perspectives and sets of knowledge.

### **Building Diverse Teams**

Imagine this conversation between two students. Both Anna and Yuanfeng are fourth-year Biology majors. Yuanfeng is 21 and currently works as a TA for a first-year biology class; Anna is 25 years old and has a computer science diploma and a couple years of programming experience. A few weeks ago Anna applied for an undergraduate research assistant job in Dr. Jones's lab.

**Yuanfeng:** Hey Anna, what happened with that job you applied for?

**Anna:** Oh, you mean that one in the Jones lab? You won’t believe this, but I actually got it!

**Yuanfeng:** Hey, well, come on — you _are_ kind of a brain box!

**Anna:** [Laughs] But I’m pretty sure I don't have as much experience in Biology lab work as some other people who applied. I mean, I know Brandon applied.

**Yuanfeng:** Why do you think you got it, then?

**Anna:** Dr. Jones said that my programming skills would be really helpful ... I guess other people on the team haven’t done too much with R and I'm the missing piece of the puzzle!

**Yuanfeng:** That’s great! You killed it!


## **Unit 3 Quiz**


### **Question 1 (1 pt)**

Which of these passages would be the most equitable definition of mitosis for a middle-school student? Choose one.

☐	Eventually cells need to duplicate. There are two main methods of replication, mitosis 	itosis is a form of eukaryotic cell division that produces two daughter cells with the same genetic component as the parent cell. Chromosomes replicated during the S phase are divided in such a way as to ensure that each daughter cell receives a copy of every chromosome. In actively dividing animal cells, the whole process takes about one hour (University of Leicester, n.d.)

☐	Mitosis is the process that facilitates the equal partitioning of replicated chromosomes into two identical groups. Both the alignment and separation processes are the consequence of the chromosomes interacting with filamentous proteinaceous structures, known as microtubules. The microtubules become organized into a biconical array known as a spindle, which forms early in mitosis, and then disassembles as mitosis nears completion. Mitotic spindles are visible in living cells with the polarizing light microscope (Wolniak, n.d.).

☐	This tutorial will talk about mitosis. The big idea to remember is that mitosis is the simple duplication of a cell and all of its parts. It duplicates its DNA and the two new cells (daughter cells) have the same pieces and genetic code. Two identical copies come from one original. Start with one; get two that are the same. You get the idea (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).


### **Question 2 (1 pt)**

Which of these practices contribute to scientific integrity? Choose all that apply.

☐	Basing research conclusions and public policy on solid information and analysis that are clearly evident to everyone

☐	Changing the hypothesis after study results have been analyzed

☐ Fully disclosing studies and methods that _don’t_ yield significant results

☐	Evaluating scientific work using fair, rigorous criteria and procedures known to all involved
