## **Unit 1: Burden of Proof**


### **Unit 1 Objectives**

This unit provides a brief look into the nature and purpose of scientific research and the background of the unfolding Open Science movement. After completing it, you should be able to articulate

*   why there is a perception that society has lost trust in the reliability of science; and
*   why a “Second Scientific Revolution” is necessary.

Shall we begin?


### **The Burden of Proof**


#### **Introduction**

Science is a beautiful thing. It is a landscape of exploration and one that at its root is tasked with finding evidence. At a fundamental level, this implies that science should be able to answer the question of _if I do this, _or_ _if I know this piece of information, how well can I predict what will follow_?

We might ask, _if I take Tylenol, will my headache go away?_ Or, _if a mealworm's environment increases by 5 degrees Celsius, will this impact its ability to reproduce?_

As you'll be exploring throughout your degree, the approach that science uses to answer these questions is to test them, and to find ways to attempt to demonstrate a relationship between them.


#### **Causal Links**

Suggesting a causal link brings with it the need to show your proof. This burden of scientific proof requires both creativity and rigour; studies must be well thought out and well executed. It also requires patience and stamina, as researchers must repeat studies to show that they result in the same conclusions time after time, reinforcing the validity of that finding.

Ask yourself, _how many times do I need to flip a coin before I can comfortably predict that the next time I flip it, there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll land on its head?_

### **Science and Social Trust**

#### **Introduction**

Science does not exist independent of the rest of society. The outputs of science — the discoveries from research — are used in all facets of life. What is a healthy lunch option? Is lead-based paint safe? What's the safest way to perform heart surgery? What should government policy be on climate change?

If science is going to be used by the public, other scientists, and policy makers to address these questions, they need to have trust in research findings and access to these findings.

#### **Trust and Access**

Trust in science relies on

*   rigour in the scientific method; and
*   **replication** (thorough repetition) of studies to increase the amount of evidence for a conclusion.

Access to science relies on

*   lack of financial barriers; and
*   outputs designed for specific audiences.


#### **Stakeholders in Science**

Designing accessible outputs for a particular audience means considering the prior knowledge, education, and needs of different **stakeholders** in science.

What is a stakeholder? Anyone who can influence or be affected by a matter. Examples include government policy makers and funders, business and industry, politicians, environmentalists, patients, and the general public.


### **A Crisis**

Much of the scientific community was shocked in 2005 when researcher, John Ioannidis, wrote a paper in the _PLOS Medicine_ journal explaining [“Why Most Published Research Findings are False.”](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)

Ioannidis was criticizing the rigour of the scientific process used by researchers in medicine. His statement sparked a movement that started questioning whether or not recent studies could be replicated: that is, could they withstand a test of their burden of proof?

Since Ioannidis published his paper, this movement has grown into a crusade seeking to transform the culture and practices of scientific research. As a society and as a species, we are at a turning point where many challenges will require us to work together across geographical, social, political, and disciplinary boundaries. We face many issues where time is of the essence, including climate change and the need to make resource use sustainable. What’s needed is a revolution to improve knowledge sharing, quality, accessibility, and trust in science.


### **Unit 1 Quiz**

#### **Question 1 (1 pt)**

What did medical researcher John Ionnanidis claim about modern research findings (choose one)?

 ☐	More than half of research findings published in medical journals these days are false.

 ☐	Modern research findings are “a bunch of bunk”.

 ☐	Registered nurses’ courses are not being updated with modern research findings in psychiatry.

 ☐	Most research findings are based on fraudulent or otherwise unethical research.



#### **Question 2 (1 pt)**

My dad has ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), and I’m doing some research on the Internet, but can’t afford an article on the effectiveness of a novel treatment treatment being offered at the Mayo Clinic. This is an issue of ________ .

☐	access

☐	trust


## **Unit 2: What Exactly is Open Science (OS)?**

### **Unit 2 Objectives**

#### **Introduction**

In Unit 1 we discussed the burden of proof and the perceived lack of social and stakeholder trust in the sciences.

This unit will explore a related issue: the ability to build up evidence for a scientific claim by repeating the original  study to make sure that the finding, be it correlative or causal, is a true finding and not just a fluke.


#### **Objectives**

After finishing this unit, you should be able to explain

*   what the Replication Crisis is; and
*   how Open Science proposes to address it.

### **A Replication Crisis**

#### **Introduction**

Open Science addresses many problems with how research is done. In essence, it aims to ensure that research can be confirmed through replication, and that both new discoveries and replications of previous research get rewarded in a similar way.

#### **Replication**

Although scientific progress rests on the repetition and reproduction of results, efforts at this are hindered by two main factors.

*   First, there is a desire for the new and shiny; that is, novel studies are more interesting.
*   Second, many studies cannot be competently analyzed or replicated. This is because critical information about them — design, data, methods, lab notes, analyses and code — may not be made available, or may be poorly communicated.

#### **A Bit of History**

Prior to the 20th century, most research data and findings could accompany their research findings. Two factors contributed to this:

*   the scale of data collection and computation was significantly smaller than it is now; and
*   scientific discoveries were communicated through long texts, rather than through short journal articles.

#### **A Crisis**

Nowadays, however, the traditional means of communicating research, the journal article, has not kept pace with the need to capture the ever-growing quantities of data and complex methods used in research. As such, research is often not accompanied by its underlying data or the detailed methods used.

In the last decade, increased awareness of these two issues, particularly in the social and life sciences, has grown to the point where many researchers describe it as a crisis: the **replication crisis**.

### **Flashy Science or Good Science?**

#### **Introduction**

New and original findings are exciting. Conducting a study over and over and getting the same results, not so much so. The consequence for science? Flashy findings get published and a lot of attention. Re-testing, or replicating these studies, not so much.

The result? Novel research gets funded and published. Sometimes, it appears, the excitement factor overrides the quality (or lack of quality) of the science.

#### **Incentives**

Replication studies are hard to fund, and many journals are not interested in publishing them. And universities and scientific institutes offer career rewards to those who publish novel findings in prestigious journals.

Academia and industry alike reward the publication of positive and significant results. Scientists may unwittingly “bend the rules” of science trying to get results worthy of publication. "Bending the rules" in this context is also known as engaging in **Questionable Research Practices** (QRPs).

#### **Questionable Research Practices**

It's important to note that QRPs don’t normally result from deliberate efforts on the part of researchers to do bad science. QRPs arise from a complex system of interactions within and around the research process and from the need for researchers to get published. After all, publications are the bread and butter of a researcher. And unfortunately, this can mean that sometimes style trumps substance, as Daniel Engber notes in his _Slate_ article “[Cancer Research Is Broken](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/future_tense/2016/04/biomedicine_facing_a_worse_replication_crisis_than_the_one_plaguing_psychology.html).”

### **Enter Open Science**

#### **Introduction**

Open Science is a movement that tries to combat the replication crisis, QRPs, and style trumping substance in two ways:

*   By providing different incentives for research. That is, changing what we measure as a success in research, shifting from a culture that focuses rewards on novel findings to a culture that also rewards the many other aspects of practising good science.
*   By making all parts of the scientific research process transparent and accessible, allowing for a critical review of how a study was conducted, and ultimately enabling that study to be reproduced.

#### **Open Science Ideals**

What sort of changes, then, would we expect Open Science to bring? Imagine a world where

*   publications and data are freely available;
*   conclusions and public policy are based on solid information and analysis that are clearly evident to all;
*   studies can be tested and repeated;
*   researchers without extensive funding or resources can still participate and collaborate in science;
*   good science — rather than flashy science, regardless of quality — brings economic rewards to those who practise it; and
*   the public trusts science and may be actively involved in research.

### **Unit 2 Quiz**

#### **Question 1 (1 pt)**

What kinds of information are needed to replicate a study? Check all possible answers.

☐	Data sets used

☐	Methods used

☐	Programming code used

☐	Names of patients in the study (if a medical study)

☐	Analysis techniques used

☐	Documentation of how data were collected

#### **Question 2 (1 pt)**

Why is it hard to get replication studies funded and published? Select all that apply.

 ☐	Journals are keener to publish findings that are new and flashy.

 ☐	Current research and publication practices don’t require the publication of all of the information needed to replicate the original study.

 ☐	Because the person who did the original study holds the copyright, other researchers have to get special permission from them to do replication studies.

 ☐	It’s pretty costly to keep repeating studies and doesn’t serve much purpose.

## **Unit 3: Core Values**

### **Unit 3 Objectives**

#### **Introduction**

In the last unit, we talked about the relationship between science and society, and tried to imagine an ideal research landscape transformed by Open Science.

In this unit we'll dive a little deeper and get to the core beliefs that underlie OS principles and practices.

The fundamental values we'll look at include

*   scientific integrity;
*   equity; and
*   diversity and inclusion.

#### **Objectives**

On completion of Unit 3, you should be able to identify how the core values that underpin Open Science intersect with the following practices and goals:

*   replicability;
*   collaboration; and
*   science communication.

### **Scientific Integrity**

Though we haven’t mentioned the phrase “scientific integrity”, we have looked at the critical role it plays in replicability and Open Science. Integrity involves sticking to best practices for research that promote reproducibility through transparency and open access. At the root, this principle springs from a sense of responsibility for public welfare and from the honest pursuit of scientific truth.

In a literal sense, transparency is the property of an object that makes it so clear that you can see through it. But what about when we talk about transparency in government policy, or scientific research? In this context, transparency implies a high degree of disclosure — revealing clearly the exact reasoning and process used in coming to a decision or taking an action. As well, transparency means taking care to disclose important information in a respectful and responsible fashion.

Scientific integrity implies several practices:

*   basing research conclusions and public policy on solid information and analysis that are clearly evident to everyone;
*   evaluating scientific work using fair, rigorous criteria and procedures known to all involved;
*   publishing good science, period (not just flashy science);
*   fully disclosing studies and methods regardless of their outcomes;
*   adhering to best practices for creating hypotheses, collecting data, and analyzing results; and
*   providing equitable access (see the following two sections on equity) to all outputs of the research cycle.

As we saw in the last unit, these form key elements of our ideal research ecosystem, where the public trusts science and studies can be tested and repeated.

#### **Transparency and Grading**

One case where students want and need transparency is in grading. Most of you probably appreciate knowing how marks were accorded to questions on a midterm exam and what criteria the marker used to score each question. This provides you with both a _reason_ for the assigned grade and a means of _comparing_ your grade with those of your classmates. Ultimately, this specific information can help you to fill in gaps in your knowledge and perform better on future assessments (such as the final exam). In the same way, transparency in research allows scientists to improve future studies and add to accumulated knowledge.

## **Equity through Access**

We do research to learn; we share our findings to build a culture of learning and to enhance the future of our disciplines. We also share to build community with researchers and other stakeholders.

But because there can be a range of stakeholders with different needs, values, and backgrounds, it is important to communicate science in ways that accommodate these characteristics. Processes and findings need to be _contextualized_ (put into a context meaningful to the particular stakeholder) and _made accessible_, both in message and medium. The more avenues through which we share and engage and the fewer barriers to access we put up, the more equitably our discoveries can be shared.


#### **Equity vs Equality**

Equity and equality are similar, but there is a key distinction: under equality everyone is treated in an identical manner, whereas under equity everyone is treated fairly according to their abilities and needs. The image below nicely illustrates the concept of equity.

### **Equity: Considering the Audience**

Equity in science communication can be explored in many ways; none addresses all issues of equitable access, but each helps to enhance scientific literacy in our society. Open access publications help to make research available to those who cannot afford costly journal subscriptions. Citizen science engages members of the public in the research process, contributing their voices to projects. Novel means and mediums of sharing a message, like podcasts or Twitter, channel findings to communities with unique access needs or preferences. In future modules, we'll explore these in more detail, but for now, let's take a quick look at how we can talk about science to meet the needs of different audiences.

Your Biology professor will change the language and techniques used to communicate scientific information to her colleagues or when she helps inform a government policy analyst writing a report. She will use a different approach again to engage you and your classmates in learning. In each case, she adjusts her communication to match her audience's needs, educational background, and experience. Her message isn't fundamentally changed or simplified, but it does need to be delivered in a way that is understanding and respectful of her audience.

#### **Effects of DDT on Birds: Three Approaches**

Consider the following three ways of explaining how DDT affects birds, and consider the intended audience of each.

##### **Aimed at Researchers in the Discipline**
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a persistent organochlorine compound found worldwide that causes significant anatomical, physiological and behavioural abnormalities in humans and wildlife. However, little is known about whether environmental exposure to DDT affects the brain. Here, we show that environmental exposure to DDT alters the brains of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) in several ways. Increasing levels of DDT resulted in: (i) smaller brain and relative forebrain volumes; (ii) a reduction in the size of two song nuclei, nucleus robustus arcopallialis (RA) and HVC; and (iii) a drastic reduction in neuronal size and overall volume of nucleus intercollicularis (ICo), a structure that is critical for normal sexual behaviour. These changes likely result from stress, direct [neurotoxicity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neurotoxicity) and [androgen receptor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/androgen-receptor) antagonism by the primary metabolite of DDT, p,p′-DDE and this is corroborated by analyses of brain region volumes and p,p′-DDE levels. Our results therefore demonstrate that environmental exposure to DDT is correlated with significant changes in the brain and specifically those structures related to mating and song. Given the magnitude of these changes in the brain and the fact that environmental DDT exposure was restricted to early development, we conclude that both humans and wildlife that live in DDT contaminated environments may be at risk of neurological damage (Iwaniuk et al., 2006).

##### **Aimed at Post-Secondary Science Students**

Concerns about DDT's effects on nontarget organisms, including birds, were first raised shortly after the end of World War II.2 By the 1960s there was good evidence that living things concentrated DDT and that it was extremely persistent. For example, scientists measured concentrations in gulls, mergansers, and cormorants that were as much as a thousand times higher than the already high concentrations in the mud of the Long Island, New York marsh where the birds fed. The marsh had been sprayed for twenty years as part of a mosquito control program.

These DDT residues caused both acute and chronic health problems. DDT caused direct mortality of some birds by poisoning their nervous system even in birds like robins that feed relatively low on the food chain. DDT and its metabolites cause eggs to have thin shells and reduce levers of a hormone necessary for female birds to lay eggs. Population declines and local disappearance of peregrine falcons, bald and golden eagles, ospreys, kestrels, and other predatory birds were recorded (Cox, 1991).


##### **Aimed at the General Public**
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks. It can accumulate in the birds of prey, giving them a large amount of DDT. High concentrations of DDT in birds cause weakness in the shells of their eggs, which leads to a reduction in their population. DDT is now banned because of this (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2019).

### **Diversity in Research Culture**

Diverse criticism of scientific ideas makes research more robust, and challenges bias and assumptions that might otherwise pass unchecked. Divergent perspectives, skill sets, and ideas introduce the "outside-of-the-box" thinking that drives research forward. Diversity implies another value, inclusion. This means making sure all voices are heard and respected in the research process.

Diversity and inclusion show up in many types of research activities that involve participation and collaboration. Participation and collaboration can take many forms. Citizen science engages the public in data collection and processing. Participatory research turns the relationship between researcher and subject into a partnership, where both contribute to the research question, process, and results. International collaborations can address problems that cross borders, like disease epidemics or pollution. Interdisciplinary research, such as biologists working with environmental scientists, can help solve complex problems like climate change by combining multiple perspectives and sets of knowledge.

#### **Building Diverse Teams**

Imagine this conversation between two students. Both Anna and Yuanfeng are fourth-year Biology majors. Yuanfeng is 21 and currently works as a TA for a first-year biology class; Anna is 25 years old and has a computer science diploma and a couple years of programming experience. A few weeks ago Anna applied for an undergraduate research assistant job in Dr. Jones's lab.

**Yuanfeng:** Hey Anna, what happened with that job you applied for?

**Anna:** Oh, you mean that one in the Jones lab? You won’t believe this, but I actually got it!

**Yuanfeng:** Hey, well, come on — you _are_ kind of a brain box!

**Anna:** [Laughs] But I’m pretty sure I don't have as much experience in Biology lab work as some other people who applied. I mean, I know Brandon applied.

**Yuanfeng:** Why do you think you got it, then?

**Anna:** Dr. Jones said that my programming skills would be really helpful ... I guess other people on the team don't have too much experience coding with R, and I'm the missing piece of the puzzle!

**Yuanfeng:** That’s great! You killed it!


### **Unit 3 Quiz**


#### **Question 1 (1 pt)**

Which of these passages would be the most equitable definition of mitosis for a middle-school student? Choose one.

☐	Eventually cells need to duplicate. There are two main methods of replication, mitosis 	itosis is a form of eukaryotic cell division that produces two daughter cells with the same genetic component as the parent cell. Chromosomes replicated during the S phase are divided in such a way as to ensure that each daughter cell receives a copy of every chromosome. In actively dividing animal cells, the whole process takes about one hour (University of Leicester, n.d.)

☐	Mitosis is the process that facilitates the equal partitioning of replicated chromosomes into two identical groups. Both the alignment and separation processes are the consequence of the chromosomes interacting with filamentous proteinaceous structures, known as microtubules. The microtubules become organized into a biconical array known as a spindle, which forms early in mitosis, and then disassembles as mitosis nears completion. Mitotic spindles are visible in living cells with the polarizing light microscope (Wolniak, n.d.).

☐	This tutorial will talk about mitosis. The big idea to remember is that mitosis is the simple duplication of a cell and all of its parts. It duplicates its DNA and the two new cells (daughter cells) have the same pieces and genetic code. Two identical copies come from one original. Start with one; get two that are the same. You get the idea (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).


#### **Question 2 (1 pt)**

Which of these practices contribute to scientific integrity? Choose all that apply.

☐	Basing research conclusions and public policy on solid information and analysis that are clearly evident to everyone

☐	Changing the hypothesis after study results have been analyzed

☐ Fully disclosing studies and methods that _don’t_ yield significant results

☐	Evaluating scientific work using fair, rigorous criteria and procedures known to all involved

## **Unit 4: Benefits of Open Science**


### **Unit 4 Objectives**


#### **Introduction**

In the preceding modules, we’ve talked a lot about what Open Science is, and what some of the core values of Open Science are. We hope we’re winning some of you over! But some of you might still be wondering what’s in it for you, your discipline, your country, or the world in a more concrete way. And we have yet to really pin down, from a benefits perspective, why we should be practising Open Science.


#### **Objectives**

On completion of Unit 4, you should be able to articulate how Open Science offers the following benefits:

*   **economic efficiencies** arising from higher-quality research;
*   **facilitation of large-scale data projects** through collaboration;
*   **improved responsiveness of policy** and research to public needs as a consequence of better and more inclusive research; and
*   **career benefits** for individual researchers.

### **Better Science and Economic Efficiencies**

#### **Creating Efficiencies**

Open Science acts like a super-fertilizer to make science grow faster and stronger. Here’s a quick review on how it does this.

*   **OS solidifies the foundation of scientific knowledge** – reproducible, robust research can be understood and replicated more easily.
*   **OS makes the research process more efficient** – data, methods, analytical techniques, and code can be reused.
*   **OS limits unnecessary research** – the publication of methods that have led to dead ends helps others to avoid making the same mistakes.


#### **From Patents to Open Science**

But let’s take this back a bit and ask, why is science closed in the first place?

On a practical level, research in the lab leads to industrial applications, whether it’s a new vaccine, a drone that uses microwave remote sensing technology to identify tree species, or a solar-powered train. In many cases, creators of such applications (or the organizations that employ them) will apply for a patent, a legal document that ensures they have the sole right to manufacture and sell the product, their **intellectual property**.

So, in many ways, patents, first issued in the 15th century, closed off science. Under patent law, only the inventor can improve the product. This limits the ability of society at large to explore and expand on the techniques and technologies applied.

In contrast, when we open up our practices to share intellectual property, we allow for accelerated innovation, which means less expensive industrial products that take less time to get to market.


#### **Example: Model My Watershed**

John’s talking to his cousin Wendy on WhatsApp. Wendy is a high school Biology teacher in the Florida Keys, South of the Florida panhandle, where water conservation is a major issue.

**John:** So, how are things going with your Biology classes?

**Wendy:** Great! I’m getting the students involved in investigating water conservation scenarios. They’re using a professional web app that lets them do analysis with real data from online repositories and model what would happen under different scenarios the local government is proposing. It’s pretty topical now, since a forested area near our school might be sold to developers!

**John:** Professional software? How can your school afford that?

**Wendy:** The app is totally free! It’s called Model My Watershed. It was built by a collaboration that included a few different universities, a water testing company, and this nonprofit called the [Stroud Water Research Center ](https://stroudcenter.org/).

**John:** Wow. So how are the students liking the project?

**Wendy:** They’ve learned a lot, and some have even written to our state rep. They feel like they can make an impact. We’re keeping track of articles about water pollution and conservation in the class.

_If you’re interested in this free app, take a look at the [Model My Watershed ](https://modelmywatershed.org/) site._


### **Large-Scale Projects**

Through the pooling of resources and, in particular, data, a project that would remain a distant dream if dependent on a single actor can become a reality.

Such collaborations can involve different research organizations, researchers from different disciplines, citizen science participation, or inter-country cooperation.

One interesting example is the digital Tree of Life, which uses published data to visualize how over two billion living things on Earth have evolved in relation to each other … going back 3.5 billion years! A collaboration of scientists from 11 different research organizations and funding through the U.S. National Science Foundation made this huge online tool possible. One of the scientists involved, genetics professor Douglas Soltis, observed, “Twenty-five years ago people said this goal of huge trees was impossible. The open tree of life is an important starting point that other investigators can now refine and improve for decades to come.” (Shekhtman, 2015). The Tree of Life can be used or edited by anyone, free of charge.

### **Improved Responsiveness of Policy and Research to Public Needs**

Involvement of citizens in research can help steer science in ways that help society and make science communication and science-based public policy more responsive to public needs. This means fewer wasted resources on poorly planned or implemented projects. Naturally, this also increases public trust in science.

The “Patient Expert” model of health care, in which patients participating in studies or treatments assume a good amount of responsibility for their own care and contribute feedback that can influence the course of future studies is an excellent example of this.


#### **Example: The CHILD-BRIGHT Network**

CHILD-BRIGHT, headquartered in Montreal, networks health practitioners, patients, families, and research scientists across Canada to advance patient-oriented care of children with brain-based developmental disabilities. This network was born out of consultation with patients and their families. The [CHILD_BRIGHT website ](https://www.child-bright.ca/citizen-engagagement)clearly outlines the importance of citizen engagement to the network’s projects:

> At CHILD-BRIGHT, ‘patients’ have been at the centre of our work since before our network was even established. We understand that patients and families are experts on their health experiences and needs and we look to them to provide us with insightful input that will influence our priorities, research study design, the outcome measures we use, as well as the interpretation and use of our findings. As a network working under Canada’s Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research, we aim to engage all people touched by brain-based developmental disabilities, especially patients and families, as meaningfully as possible in all aspects of our work.

CHILD-BRIGHT holds summer camps for children at research centres in Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto under the SPORT (Stimulation for Perinatal Stroke Optimizing Recovery Trajectory) program. Children in the camp receive trial treatments aimed at improving their motor function, as well as undergoing testing and imaging for research. Their participation helps to build data sets for studies, and guides the direction of future research. Of course, some fun is involved as well! Many of the children have reported improved function through the camps’ treatments.


### **Career Benefits for Researchers**

Open science helps researchers – especially those in the beginning stages of their careers – in many ways:

*   **increased visibility** – for example, authors who publish openly may receive early coverage in the media;
*   **enhanced networks** – chances to make connections, exchange, and collaborate, creating greater opportunity for advancement;
*   **greater employability** – both at universities and outside of the academic world, such as in industry and government: early-career applicants stand out if they have experience in reproducible practices; and
*   **unique funding and publishing opportunities** – many funders and journals now require that researchers make their data public and participate in other Open practices.

#### **Example: Exposure of Honours Work**

Sammie is doing their honours thesis in biology at UBCO. They’re using a popular online tool for sharing research inputs and outputs, [OSF](https://osf.io/), to help manage their project.

Sammie recently presented their work at a local conference. Their poster focused on high-level outcomes, but provided a link to the full working project on OSF for those who were more interested in the nitty gritty of the work.

In the following months, Sammie started to notice that more and more people were visiting their OSF page. Some people were even downloading portions of Sammie’s work.

Applying for graduate opportunities, Sammie was able to point to both their project work and the visitor stats it was receiving.

Three months after the conference, Sammie got the following email:

> Dear Sammie,
>
> I was very pleased to come across your poster session at a conference several months back. A colleague at your institution reached out to me more recently about your work and I have since had a look at what you’re doing on your OSF page. If you’re looking for a graduate research opportunity, I’d be happy to talk, as the work that you are doing would align very nicely with my research lab at _The Joy of Science Institute_ in Florida.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> Dr. Bob Ross

As you might imagine, Sammie was pretty excited.

## **Unit 5: Challenges and Constraints**

### **Unit 5 Objectives**

#### **Introduction**

If Open Science is so great, why isn't it more widespread?

We have the technological means, and indeed a duty, to open science in order to solve problems facing our society and our world. This unit looks at the difficulties in implementing Open Science and strategies to overcome them.

#### **Objectives**

On completion of Unit 5, you should be able to articulate and identify a strategy for addressing each of the following hindrances to practising Open Science:

*   lack of **incentives;**
*   **publishing** industry practices;
*   lack of **awareness and training;** and
*   **intellectual property** rights.

### **Incentives and Rewards**

#### **The Current Reward System**

As we saw in Unit 2, flashy science may trump good science. The actors involved here are four: researchers, publishers, employers, and funders. Traditional research outputs (academic papers) are coordinated by publishers, while researcher rewards — tenure, wages, and grants — are handled by their employers and/or funders.

As you'll recall, journals want to publish exciting research. You could say this is good business sense.

Funders, as well, want their projects to achieve clear, novel, and measurable results; they obviously want to be able to justify _why_ they invested in a given project. Employers want to know that their institution is having an impact — and researcher impact figures as an extremely important measure of institutional impact.

Researchers’ impact is gauged largely by the number of times their research is cited by others, the prestige of the journals they publish in, and the level of funding they can get. Thus, the rewards a researcher receives depend largely on outputs of journals.

You can see we have a bit of a conflict here. Researchers may want to change their practices, but if such changes negatively affect whether and where they're published, they'll fall out of favour with their employers and funders. At the same time, funders and employers struggle to find other ways to _measure_ research impact to coordinate funding and to demonstrate value.

#### **Strategies for Change**

Strategies for change centre on how _value_ and _impact_ are interpreted and understood in the context of research. And many large organizations representing researchers, publishers, employers, and funders have started to change the way in which they evaluate these factors.

A few key developments have sparked and motivated some of these shifts.

##### **Metrics for Assessment**

In 2012, the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology in San Francisco gave rise to the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). This document calls on all parties involved in the research process to critically re-evaluate how research is assessed for merit. It has since turned into a worldwide initiative with thousands of individual and organizational supporters. [You can read more about DORA here. ](https://sfdora.org/)

##### **Funder Requirements**

Since 2015, the three major Canadian research agencies -- the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) -- have required that recipients of their research grants provide open access to the resulting papers within a year of publication. These same agencies are currently working on a similar policy for research data.[ You can read more about the Tri-Agencies Open Access Policy here.](https://scholcomm.ubc.ca/open-access/tri-agency-open-access-policy/)

##### **Journal Efforts**

In 2014, the journal _Psychological Science_ broke new ground by awarding badges to papers based on the level of openness demonstrated in them — an incentive for authors to adopt open practices. Under the guidance of UBC's own Eric Eich, Editor-in-Chief of the journal at that time, authors began to receive badges for three types of OS practices: open data, open materials, and preregistration (filing their research design with the journal at the earliest stage of the study). These badges were then added as images to the paper. Before badges were introduced, fewer than 3% of papers in _Psychological Science_ reported that their data was open. By mid 2015, this percentage had grown by a factor of 13 to 39% (Kidwell et al., 2016)!

### **Publishing Industry Practices**

Publishers of journals can do a lot to support more robust science and to encourage a culture of Open among researchers. As we saw, _Psychological Science_ found a simple, effective way for researchers to communicate how open they are.

As you might recall from Unit 2, one of the issues researchers face for getting published, is the need for their results to be positive. To combat this, and to encourage really good science, a handful of journals have started to support a new publishing model called Registered Reports.

In a traditional paper, peer review happens when a paper is submitted to the journal for publication: that is, _after_ the research has been done. This process encourages researchers to revisit their findings and try to find positive results where they couldn't before. This phenomenon is commonly known as _p_-hacking. We'll take a closer look at what _p_-hacking is in later modules.

In Registered Reports, researchers submit their planned research project to a journal and _the plan is reviewed_. If the plan is accepted, the journal guarantees that they will publish the article, whether the findings are positive or not! Peer review of the manuscript still occurs. But now, the _guarantee_ of publication — regardless of the study’s outcome — frees authors to focus on doing the best possible research.

[You can read more about Registered Reports and see what the process looks like here.](https://cos.io/rr/)


### **Lack of Awareness and Training**

Most researchers today haven't been trained in Open Science practices. They would likely agree philosophically with opening science, but may not know where to start in terms of modifying their practices. And those in later stages of their career may think that change is too difficult, even if their graduate students try to engage them in talking about Open Science.

#### **A Learning Curve**

Learning a new way of conducting science involves time and effort.

Depending on where you are in your career, this time and effort is more or less valuable and easier or harder to come by. For example, longtime researchers may struggle with time that learning will take away from their current responsibilities that have grown over the years, including managing students, administrative tasks, applying for grants, and teaching.

The fact is, Open Science practices involve investing more time at the start of a research project, because they require you to think through the entire project, map out what you're going to do, and to try to foresee where errors could happen so you can prevent them or soften their blows. However, the investment pays off in increased scientific rigour, less time spent on the end of the project, and increased efficiencies in future projects.

Embracing Open Science education may also mean having to grasp new technologies, and some people, even in the sciences, feel discomfort with learning new tech.

Finally, researchers may be concerned with the costs potentially associated with Open Science, from fees for keeping data in an open repository to time required to learn OS practices.  Low-cost or free options for data storage may be available through universities or other organizations.

#### **Advocating for Open**

To help researchers clear the learning curve, Open Science advocates seek to make information about Open Science benefits, tools, and practices available to researchers at all levels. Initiatives include the following:

*   free, easy-to-use tools that don't require coding, like the Open Science Framework (OSF), a project management and networking site that allows researchers to display and interact with all products of their research;
*   free storage for researchers, whether through third parties like[ OSF](https://osf.io/) or[ Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), or through their institution. At UBC, we have[ cIRcle](https://circle.ubc.ca/) for publications and[ Dataverse](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/ubc) for data;
*   OS education programs (including this one) at universities aimed at undergraduates, graduates, and early career researchers;
*   mentoring programs that team a researcher experienced with OS methods with colleagues new to OS; and
*   courses in specific aspects of Open Science, such as those offered by the[ FOSTER portal (a project of the European Union).](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/courses)

### **Intellectual Property Rights**

#### **Introduction**

Our economy and legal system have long recognized the rights of creators of ideas, methods, products, etc. to own the products of their creation. These rights provide a strong incentive for research and innovation, both for individual creators and for society through the production of new knowledge, goods, and services.

However, as we know, Open Science also provides strong stimulation to the economy by improving the quality of science and industrial products and services, and making scientific knowledge broadly available to creators or potential creators.

So, intellectual property rights and Open Science exist together in a tense but interdependent relationship; policy makers and all of the actors in the culture of science must work to strike a balance between these two concepts.

#### **A Public-Private Partnership, the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC)**

The Structural Genomics Consortium accelerates research into human biology and drugs through a multi-country network that includes hundreds of university labs. The SGC makes its research outputs available free of charge, but its funding comes from private companies, including two giant pharmaceutical corporations, Bayer (German) and Pfizer (American). What’s more, it focuses on “neglected” diseases -- those linked with areas of the human genome that have not yet been well studied. Canadian nodes in the SGC include the Montreal Neurological Institute (“The Neuro”, a brain research centre) and the University of Toronto.
