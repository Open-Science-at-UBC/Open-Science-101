OS 101 Unit 4: Open Science Benefits

## Unit 4 Objectives

### Introduction
In the preceding modules, we've talked a lot about what Open Science is, and what some of the core values of Open Science are. Hopefully we're winning some of you over with an ethos of practice. But some of you might still be wondering what's in it for you, your discipline, your country, or the world in a more concrete way. And we have yet to really pin down, from a benefits perspective, why we should be practising Open Science.

### Objectives
On completion of Unit 4, you should be able to articulate how Open Science offers the following benefits:
- Economic efficiencies arising from higher-quality research;
- Facilitation of large-scale projects through collaboration;
- Improved responsiveness of policy and research to public needs as a consequence of better and more inclusive research; and
- Career benefits for individual researchers.

## Better Science and Economic Efficiencies

Open Science acts like a super-fertilizer to make science grow faster and stronger. How does it do this?
 - The reproducible, robust research can be understood and replicated more easily, solidifying the foundation of scientific knowledge;
 - data, methods, analytical techniques, and code can be re-used, accelerating the research process
 - publication of methods that have led to dead ends in research helps others in the research community to avoid making the same mistakes

On a practical level, research in the lab leads to industrial applications, whether it's a new vaccine, a drone that uses microwave remote sensing technology to map root zone soil moisture, or a solar-powered train. Accelerated innovation means less expensive industrial products that take less time to get to market.

Science finds another application in public policy decisions: like industrial products, they need to be based on sound, replicable science.  

### Example: Open APS
John's talking to his cousin in the States on WhatsApp.   

John: So, Bubba, how's it goin' with the diabetes?  

Bubba: Pffffff, my control hasn't been so hot lately.   Can't seem to get it better no matter what I do.  

John: Don't they have an artificial pancreas now?

Bubba: Yeah, if you have 15 grand to blow on one.   

Two days later ...  

John: Hey Bubba, just read something interesting -- someone down there invented an artificial pancreas type system that costs only $200! Lots of people are using it. It's called OpenAPS.  

Bubba: You're pulling my leg, man. Must've forgot a couple of zeroes on that price. How could they afford to make it available for $200?  

John: It's kinda DIY -- take a look here. You've gotta do some work to get it and keep it going I guess. [Sends url: https://openaps.org/.]  

Bubba: Holy guacamole! I'll look into it. Thanks John.

## Large-Scale Projects
Through the pooling of resources and data and the sharing of knowledge, a project that would remain a distant dream if dependent on a single actor can become a reality. Such collaborations can involve different research organizations, researchers from different disciplines, citizen science participation, or inter-country cooperation.  One interesting such example is that of Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, which now provides for the vaccination of half the world's children through by pooling the data and resources of many countries and facilitating cooperation between governmental and non-governmental organizations in poorer parts of the world.
### Example: Yusuf Becomes a Vaccine Advocate
On the Gavi website, at https://www.gavi.org/delivering/nigeria/#InWords, you can read the story of Yusuf Ibrahim, a devout Muslim in Nigeria who originally was told that vaccines were part of a Western conspiracy to control the Muslim population by delivering medicine that made men impotent. The elders asked, "Why would they give us this medication free?" Given their historical experiences with Western culture, this attitude is unsurprising. When his beloved daughter caught pneumonia and died, he began to talk to doctors about his beliefs and to learn more about vaccines. Now he's a strong advocate for vaccines among the people of his town.

## Improved Responsiveness of Policy and Research to Public Needs
Involvement of citizens in research can help steer science in ways that help society and make science communication and science-based public policy more responsive to public needs. Naturally, this also increases public trust in science. The "Patient Expert" model of health care, in which patients participating in studies or treatments assume a good amount of responsibility for their own care and contribute feedback that can influence the course of future studies.

### Example: The CHILD-BRIGHT Network
CHILD-BRIGHT, headquartered in Montreal, networks health practitioners, patients, families, and research scientists across Canada to advance patient-oriented care of children with brain-based developmental disabilities.  This network was born out of consultation with patients and their families find out what their priorities and needs were. The website at https://www.child-bright.ca/citizen-engagagement makes the importance of citizen engagement to the network's projects clear:

> At CHILD-BRIGHT, 'patients' have been at the centre of our work since before our network was even established. We understand that patients and families are experts on their health experiences and needs and we look to them to provide us with insightful input that will influence our priorities, research study design, the outcome measures we use, as well as the interpretation and use of our findings.
> 
> As a network working under Canada's Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research, we aim to engage all people touched by brain-based developmental disabilities, especially patients and families, as meaningfully as possible in all aspects of our work.

CHILD-BRIGHT holds summer camps for children at research centres in Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto under the SPORT (Stimulation for Perinatal Stroke Optimizing Recovery Trajectory) program. Children in the camp receive trial treatments aimed at improving their motor function, as well as undergoing testing and imaging for research. Their participation helps to build data sets for studies, and guides the direction of future research. Of course, some fun is involved as well! Many of the children have reported improved function through the camps' treatments. 

## Benefits for Researchers
 Open science helps researchers -- especially those in the beginning stages of their careers -- in many ways:
 - increased visibility for them and their research, more citations (introduce dialogue); for example, authors who publish openly may receive early coverage in the media
 - compliance with the requirements that many funders and journals now have for open practices in studies
 - chances to make connections, exchange, and collaborate. Greater opportunity for advancement.
 - Reproducibility is also valued in contexts outside of the academic world, such as in industry: earl-career applicants stand out if they have experience in reproducible practices
 
### Example: Exposure of Honours Work
 Sammie is now doing their honours thesis and is publishing notes on Open Science Framework, a portal for sharing research inputs and outputs of all types. The research attracts the attention of a well-established professor working in the area Sammie is interested in. This professor suggests taking Sammie on as a graduate student at his institution, and offers some helpful advice as well. *Convert to dialogue between Sammie and the professor?*

## For Later Modules?
   Improvement of statistical techniques (is this only in Psychology?): shift from reliance on null-hypothesis significance testing to estimation and other preferred techniques; reliance on estimation and other preferred methods. Dichotomy of NHST can impede scientific progress - focus on practical significance of effects and steady accumulation of knowledge

### Technological Advancement
   **This helps OS. Is it a benefit of OS?** - Hmmm, Mathew, you are probably right. I do think that open science has probably driven at least some technological developments -- e.g. platforms like OSF, open source applications like Dataverse, etc. But perhaps that's not a societal benefit in the way we're conceiving it, or not one that students could relate to.
