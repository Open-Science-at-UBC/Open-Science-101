OS 101 Unit 1: Burden of Proof
## Unit 1 Objectives

### Objectives
This unit provides a brief look into the nature and purpose of scientific research and the background of the unfolding Open Science movement. After completing it, you should be able to articulate:
-   why there is a perception that society has lost trust in the reliability of science; and
-   why a “Second Scientific Revolution” is necessary.

Shall we begin?

## The Burden of Proof

### Introduction

Science is a beautiful thing. It is a landscape of exploration and one that at its root is tasked with finding evidence. At a fundamental level, this implies that science should be able to answer the question of _if I do this,_ or _if I know this piece of information, how well can I predict what will follow_?

We might ask, _if I take Tylenol, will my headache go away?_ Or, _if a mealworm's environment increases by 5 degrees Celsius, will this impact its ability to reproduce?_

As you'll be exploring throughout your degree, the approach that science uses to answer these questions is to test them, and to find ways to attempt to demonstrate a relationship between them.

### Causal Links

Suggesting a causal link brings with it the need to show your proof. This burden of scientific proof requires both creativity and rigour; studies must be well thought out and well executed. It also requires patience and stamina, since repetition of a conclusion reinforces the validity of that finding.

Ask yourself, how many times would you need to flip a coin before you would comfortably suggest that the next time you flipped that coin, there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll land on its head?

## Science and Social Trust

### Introduction

Science does not exist independent of the rest of society. The outputs of science -- the discoveries from research -- are used in all facets of life. What is a healthy lunch option? Is lead-based paint safe? What's the safest way to perform heart surgery? What should government policy be on climate change?

If science is going to be used by the public, other scientists, and policy makers to address these questions, they need to have trust in research findings and access to these findings.

### Trust and Access

Trust in science relies on

-   Rigour in the scientific method;
-   Replication (thorough repetition) of studies to increase the amount of evidence for a conclusion.

Access to science relies on

-   Lack of financial barriers;
-   Outputs designed for specific audiences.

### Stakeholders in Science

Designing accessible outputs for a particular audience means considering the prior knowledge, education, and needs of different **stakeholders** in science.

What is a stakeholder? Anyone who can influence or can be affected by a matter. Examples of these could include government policy makers and funders, business and industry, politicians, environmentalists, patients, and the general public.

## Unit 1 Quiz

☐ Registered nurses’ courses are not being updated with modern research findings in psychiatry.
☐ More than half of research findings published in medical journals these days are false.

### Question 2 (1 pt)
