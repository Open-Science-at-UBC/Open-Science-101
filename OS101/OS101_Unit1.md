# **OS 101 Unit 1: Burden of Proof**
## **Unit 1 Objectives**

### **Unit 1 Objectives**
This unit provides a brief look into the nature and purpose of scientific research and the background of the unfolding Open Science movement. After completing it, you should be able to articulate
-   why there is a perception that society has lost trust in the reliability of science; and
-   why a “Second Scientific Revolution” is necessary.

Shall we begin?

## **The Burden of Proof**

### **Introduction**

Science is a beautiful thing. It is a landscape of exploration and one that at its root is tasked with finding evidence. At a fundamental level, this implies that science should be able to answer the question of _if I do this,_ or _if I know this piece of information, how well can I predict what will follow_?

We might ask, _if I take Tylenol, will my headache go away?_ Or, _if a mealworm's environment increases by 5 degrees Celsius, will this impact its ability to reproduce?_

As you'll be exploring throughout your degree, the approach that science uses to answer these questions is to test them, and to find ways to attempt to demonstrate a relationship between them.

### **Causal Links**

Suggesting a causal link brings with it the need to show your proof. This burden of scientific proof requires both creativity and rigour; studies must be well thought out and well executed. It also requires patience and stamina, as researchers must repeat studies to show that they result in the same conclusions time after time, reinforcing the validity of that finding.

Ask yourself, _how many times do I need to flip a coin before I can comfortably predict the next time I flip it, there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll land on its head?_

## **Science and Social Trust**

### **Introduction**

Science does not exist independent of the rest of society. The outputs of science -- the discoveries from research -- are used in all facets of life. What is a healthy lunch option? Is lead-based paint safe? What's the safest way to perform heart surgery? What should government policy be on climate change?

If science is going to be used by the public, other scientists, and policy makers to address these questions, they need to have trust in research findings and access to these findings.

### **Trust and Access**

Trust in science relies on

-   rigour in the scientific method; and
-   **replication** (thorough repetition) of studies to increase the amount of evidence for a conclusion.

Access to science relies on

-   lack of financial barriers; and
-   outputs designed for specific audiences.

### **Stakeholders in Science**

Designing accessible outputs for a particular audience means considering the prior knowledge, education, and needs of different **stakeholders** in science.

What is a stakeholder? Anyone who can influence or be affected by a matter. Examples include government policy makers and funders, business and industry, politicians, environmentalists, patients, and the general public.

### **A Crisis**

Much of the scientific community was shocked in 2005 when researcher, John Ioannidis, wrote a paper in the _PLOS Medicine_ journal explaining [“Why Most Published Research Findings are False.”](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)

Ioannidis was criticizing the rigour of the scientific process used by researchers in medicine. His statement sparked a movement that started questioning whether or not recent studies could be replicated: that is, could they withstand a test of their burden of proof?

Since Ioannidis published his paper, this movement has grown into a crusade seeking to transform the culture and practices of scientific research. As a society and as a planet, we are at a turning point where many challenges will require us to work together across geographical, social, political, and disciplinary boundaries. We face many issues where time is of the essence, including climate change and biodiversity loss. What’s needed is a revolution to improve knowledge sharing, quality, accessibility, and trust in science.

## **Unit 1 Quiz**

### **Question 1 (1 pt)**

What did medical researcher John Ionnanidis claim about modern research findings (choose one)?

☐ Most research findings are based on fraudulent or otherwise unethical research.

☐ Modern research findings are “a bunch of bunk”.

☐ Registered nurses’ courses are not being updated with modern research findings in psychiatry.

☐ More than half of research findings published in medical journals these days are false.

### **Question 2 (1 pt)**

My dad has ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), and I’m doing some research on the Internet, but can’t afford an article on the effectiveness of a novel treatment treatment being offered at the Mayo Clinic. This is an issue of ________.

☐ access

☐ trust
