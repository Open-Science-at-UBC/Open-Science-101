 OS 101 Unit 4: Open Science Benefits

## Unit 4 Objectives

### Introduction
In the preceding modules, we've talked a lot about what Open Science is, and what some of the core values of Open Science are. Hopefully we're winning some of you over with an ethos of practice. But some of you might still be wondering what's in it for you, your discipline, your country, or the world in a more concrete way. And we have yet to really pin down, from a benefits perspective, why we should be practicing Open Science.

### Objectives
On completion of Unit 4, you should be able to articulate how Open Science offers the following benefits:
- Economic efficiencies arising from higher-quality research
- **Accelerated Innovation** (Pooling/collaboration)
  - Amongst fellow researchers
  - Leaps in knowledge
  - Because of pooled efforts with non-professional scientists (citizen science)
  - vaccine example: https://vaccine-safety-training.org/global-vaccine-safety-datanet.html

- **Improved Responsiveness of Policy and Research to Public Needs**
  - better policy -- *A consequence of better research. Also a link back to trust here. And a partial recap of previous modules.*
  - citizen science
  - patient-directed research
  - results in greater trust

- **Increased Visibility of Research and Researchers**
  - benefits to individual researchers (exposure, media, collaboration, mentorship)
  - improvement in communication of science --> improved trust, public awareness

## Better Science and Economic Efficiencies

Open Science acts like a super-fertilizer to make science grow faster and stronger. How does it do this?
 - reproducible, robust research can be understand and replicated more easily, solidifying the foundation of scientific knowledge
 - data, methods, analytical processes, and code can be re-used, accelerating the course of research
 - awareness of techniques and strategies that have led to dead ends helps scientists to avoid repeating each other's mistakes

On a practical level, research in the lab leads to industrial applications, whether it's a new vaccine, a drone that uses microwave remote sensing technology to map root zone soil moisture, or a solar-powered train. Accelerated innovation means less expensive industrial products that take less time to get to market.

Science finds another application in public policy decisions: like industrial products, they need to be based on sound, replicable science.  

### Example: Open APS
John's talking to his cousin in the States on WhatsApp.   

John: So, Bubba, how's it goin' with the diabetes?  

Bubba: Pffffff, my control hasn't been so hot lately.   Can't seem to get it better no matter what I do.  

John: Don't they have an artificial pancreas now?

Bubba: Yeah, if you have 15 grand to blow on one.   

Two days later ...  

John: Hey Bubba, just read something interesting -- someone down there invented an artificial pancreas type system that costs only $200! Lots of people are using it. It's called OpenAPS.  

Bubba: You're pulling my leg, man. Must've forgot a couple of zeroes on that price. How could they afford to make it available for $200?  

John: It's kinda DIY -- take a look here. You've gotta do some work to get it and keep it going I guess. [Sends url: https://openaps.org/.]  

Bubba: Holy guacamole! I'll look into it. Thanks John.

## Accelerated Innovation
 -   Open access → greater diversity in research, leading to leaps in scientific knowledge, giving voice to under-represented interests, etc.
*These creative ‘aha’ moments always seem sudden and unexpected. Ideas ‘pop-up out of nowhere’ and this can make creativity seem mysterious or mystical. However, researchers have been able to identify the social and psychological factors that influence creativity. One such finding is that multicultural experiences enhance creativity. There are quite a few examples of creative individuals who did their best work while they were living abroad. Picasso, Handel, Hemingway and Stravinsky all created their most well-regarded work while living in foreign countries.*

 - Example: Combining indigenous and Western water-safety research (Nature article)
[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05316-5](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05316-5) (this example also involves science comm/citizen science).

> *Chanel Phillips tried hard to keep her nerves in check last year as she prepared to present her research at an international meeting on drowning prevention. Phillips, a doctoral student at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, was in Vancouver, Canada, discussing water-safety strategies that she had been developing with indigenous Maori communities back home. It struck her that she and a colleague were perhaps the only indigenous presenters at the meeting.  She forged ahead, discussing unconventional work that blends Western and traditional Maori research methods to an audience of experts from around the world. Her presentation was warmly received. Researchers bombarded her with questions about working with indigenous groups — which often face rates of drowning that are higher than national averages. More important to Phillips, however, were the eager questions and comments coming from the Maori community members whom she worked with: she had live-streamed her talk so that they could listen and weigh in. “That was a big moment for me,” she says.*

-   Through citizen science and marshaling the resources of the many (e.g. crowdfunding, species counts, distributed computing), large-scale research projects that would otherwise be impossible or impractical can be realized.
Example: XSEDE and the Tree of Life
> An outline for a new tree of life, depicting the evolution of life on this planet that included more than 1,000 new types of bacteria and Archaea lurking in the Earth’s nooks and crannies, was made possible with the help of supercomputing resources available through XSEDE (eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment), along with a  phylogenetics “gateway” available on those resources.The new tree, published in April 2016 in the new journal Nature Microbiology and widely publicized throughout the general press, reinforces once again that the life we see around us – plants, animals, humans and other so-called eukaryotes – represents but a tiny percentage of the world’s biodiversity.“The tree of life is one of the most important organizing principles in biology,” said Jill Banfield, a University of
California, Berkeley professor of earth and planetary science, policy, and management, and the study’s principal investigator. “The new depiction will be of use not only to biologists who study microbial ecology, but also biochemists searching for novel genes and researchers studying evolution and earth history.” Researchers used the CIPRES (CyberInfrastructure for Phylogenetic RESearch), a web-based portal or gateway that allows researchers to explore evolutionary relationships between species.“The CIPRES Science Gateway was critical to our work,” said Laura Hug, who computed the trees at the University of California, Berkeley and is now a biology faculty member at the University of Waterloo (Canada). “Previous attempts to infer the trees presented severe problems with run time, memory allocation and a lack of parallelized implementation of the RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood), a popular program for phylogenetic analysis of large datasets. No run had successfully finished prior to our introduction to CIPRES.

## Benefits for Researchers
 Open science helps researchers -- especially those in the beginning stages of their careers -- in many ways:
 - increased visibility for them and their research, more citations (introduce dialogue); for example, authors who publish openly may receive early coverage in the media
 - compliance with the requirements that many funders and journals now have for open practices in studies
 - chances to make connections, exchange, and collaborate. Greater opportunity for advancement.
 - Reproducibility is also valued in contexts outside of the academic world, such as in industry: earl-career applicants stand out if they have experience in reproducible practices
 
### Example: Exposure of Honours Work
 Sammie is now doing their honours thesis and is publishing notes on Open Science Framework, a portal for sharing research inputs and outputs of all types. The research attracts the attention of a well-established professor working in the area Sammie is interested in. This professor suggests taking Sammie on as a graduate student at his institution, and offers some helpful advice as well. *Convert to dialogue between Sammie and the professor?*

## Improved Responsiveness of Policy and Research to Public Needs
Increased public trust in science, resulting from improved science communication, citizen science, increases in reliability of science(?), responsiveness of science to people's needs
  Example: the "Patient Expert" model of health care

Stimulation for Perinatal Stroke Optimizing Recovery Trajectory (SPORT)
> This past year, our SPORT team welcomed participants to summer camps
> at all 3 of our study sites: Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto. At these
> camps, participants receive our noninvasive brain stimulation
> intervention to achieve new motor function goals while also building
> their confidence and making new friends. In total, 37 participants
> have enrolled in our project, keeping us on track to achieve our goal
> of more than 80 participants, making our project the largest such
> rehabilitation trial ever done in children worldwide! We are also very
> proud to share that all of the families enrolled in the summer camps
> have attended subsequent testing and brain imaging appointments over
> the 6 months following the camp. This is a wonderful testament to the
> commitment of our families and team and is helping us build a rich
> data set of clinical imaging and brain physiology outcomes that will
> help us understand how young brains recover from early injury. We
> enjoy consistently receiving positive feedback from parents and SPORT
> campers, with many asking: “Can we come back next summer?”

 - Quote from camp participant (base dialogue on this? perhaps a dialogue between parents of camp children?)

>  Brandon was soooo excited today that he could open his palm and keep
> his thumb out!!! That’s a big improvement for him. He talked my ear
> off the whole way home. Says he wants to keep the cast on for week 2
> and wants the camp to last a month. Thank you and the whole team for
> all your efforts for these kids.” --Brandon’s parent


## For Later Modules?
   Improvement of statistical techniques (is this only in Psychology?): shift from reliance on null-hypothesis significance testing to estimation and other preferred techniques; reliance on estimation and other preferred methods. Dichotomy of NHST can impede scientific progress - focus on practical significance of effects and steady accumulation of knowledge

## Technological Advancement
   **This helps OS. Is it a benefit of OS?**
    -   Introduction of new technologies, platforms, and publication media.
    - e.g. Geodisy project from Open Science in Practice
   [https://researchdata.library.ubc.ca/find/geodisy/](https://researchdata.library.ubc.ca/find/geodisy/)
   - make up practical application --> dialogue?
   - contact Mark and Paul re: their lightning talk on Geodesy? There was a good example of a friend's research being helped by Geodesy. Can't find my notes on this (dang!!)
